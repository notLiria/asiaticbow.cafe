The minimum box dimension is the size of the smallest box that you could put an unstrung bow into, without rotating the bow in any way.

In other words, we measure the bow lengthwise to find the longest dimension, then measure the width that it has in that orientation, and then measure the total thickness of the bow.

This measurement actually gives us a little bit of insight into the bow's design - namely, it gives us the amount of reflex that a bow has. A little bit of an interesting tidbit. That said, we've used this dimension a couple times now to, well, figure out how to stick bows into boxes for shipping. Of course, these dimensions do not include padding for if you're actually shipping the bow, so make sure to leave a couple cm extra if you're going to actually ship it!
